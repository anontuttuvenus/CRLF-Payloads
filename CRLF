Here are some examples of how to use CRLF injection payloads:

* **Normal payloads:**
    * `%0D%0A`
    * `\r\n`
    * `\n`
    * `%0A`
    * `\r`
    * `%0D`

These payloads can be used to inject a newline character into a web request, which can then be used to bypass certain security controls. For example, a CRLF injection payload could be used to bypass a web application firewall (WAF) that is configured to block requests that contain newline characters.

* **WAF bypass payloads:**
    * `%250D%250A`
    * `%250A`
    * `%250D`
    * `%25250D%25250A`
    * `%25250A`
    * `%25250D`

These payloads can be used to bypass WAFs that are configured to block requests that contain certain characters, such as newline characters. For example, a WAF bypass payload could be used to inject a newline character into a web request, even if the WAF is configured to block requests that contain newline characters.

To use a CRLF injection payload, you can simply add the payload to the end of a web request. For example, if you are making a request to the URL `http://example.com/index.php`, you could add the payload `%0D%0A` to the end of the URL, like this:

`http://example.com/index.php%0D%0A`

When the web server receives the request, it will interpret the payload as a newline character and process the request accordingly. This could allow you to bypass certain security controls, such as WAFs.
